# Game Engine Programming Game

This is a basic 2D "bubble shooter" game.  
The goal of the game is to clear all the bubbles from the screen.

## Main components

- Hexagon grid layout -> 2d array
- Mouse position -> Get angle where the bubble is shot
- Bubbles are assigned numbers (empty cell = 0)
- Bubble hit a cell with a bubble in it -> Check for adjency
- Wall collision
- OnMouseButtonLeft event:
    1. Shoot bubble
    2. Check for wall collisions
    3. Check for bubble collisions
        1. handle bubble conditions

## Technical Notes

We need to figure out how to get the mouse position.  
The bubble being shot has the position (0, 0) so the shot angle will be calculated based on that.

### Wall collision

This might suffice (though we might need something more complex):  
If ball.position > rightWall.x (On the right side x is positive)  
If ball.position < leftWall.x (On the left side x is negative)

#### Ball new movement angle:
Angle between wall and floor = 90  
Ball incoming to wall angle = 90 - inbound (we might need to flip the sign based on the wall we are hitting against)

NOTE: The inbound angle always forms a right triangle  
TODO: How do i calculate the outbound angle

## Bubble conditions

If 3 or more in a row -> clear the bubbles
If bubbles of a given number no longer exist, do not shoot them.
If no bubbles exist in the grid, player wins.
If any bubble hits the buttom row, player loses.
